# Neural-network-for-image-classifcation.

The following is a project based on tensorflow library to create a neural network that classifies image in different categories.

edit the nn1.py as per requirement.(if dataset is in ubyte format.)

else use imagedata.py which converts the dataset(images) into the required fomat and trains the neural network.

it creates a model file with *.hp5 extention use this to test on custom images.

NN parameters 
1 input layer.
1 dense layer 128 neurons.
1 softmax layer for results.
Adam optimiser.

further itrations in model design can be done for better performance such as making 2dconv layes etc and making more deep models.
